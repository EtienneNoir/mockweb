                    <p>The Oppidan community is the single largest student body per hall at Rhodes University. The Hall Boasts approximately 3500 students out of a total student body of approximately 8100 students.Oppidans enjoy the benefits of increased independence and freedom from some of the structures of life in residence, but off-campus living also provides its challenges and unique experiences.

                      Please remember however that all students are bound by the same student disciplinary code whether you are in residence or living in digs. This site is here to assist Oppidans, present and future, in overcoming challenges and in maximising the benefits of your living and learning journey at Rhodes University.</p>
